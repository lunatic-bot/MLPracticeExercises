# Machine Learning Practice Exercises

Welcome to my Machine Learning practice repository! This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks where I practice various machine learning algorithms and techniques using different datasets. Each notebook focuses on a specific concept, algorithm, or problem-solving approach in machine learning.

## Contents

Each notebook in this repository demonstrates the application of machine learning models and techniques on various datasets. The types of algorithms covered include, but are not limited to:

- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Feature Engineering and Feature Selection
- Data Preprocessing (Scaling, Encoding)
- Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Cross-validation and Performance Metrics
- Time Series Forecasting
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) Models

You can find notebooks organized based on the algorithms or problem types in the following sections:

### 1. Supervised Learning

- **Regression**: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- **Classification**: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Networks

### 2. Unsupervised Learning

- **Clustering**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE, LDA

### 3. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling (Standardization, Normalization)
- Feature selection techniques (Univariate, Recursive Feature Elimination)

### 4. Model Evaluation

- Cross-validation
- Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV)
- Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC)

## Datasets

The datasets used in the notebooks come from various sources, including Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, and other publicly available datasets. The primary goal of these exercises is to practice machine learning concepts and improve my skills with real-world data.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks in this repository, you need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`
- `tensorflow` (for deep learning models)
- `nltk` (for NLP tasks)
- `statsmodels` (for time series models)
- `keras`

You can install these libraries using `pip` or `conda`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or, you can manually install them by running:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost tensorflow nltk statsmodels keras
```

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lunatic-bot/MLPracticeExercises.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the repository folder:

   ```bash
   cd MLPracticeExercises
   ```

3. Open any Jupyter notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   You can start exploring the notebooks by opening them in a Jupyter Notebook interface or any other compatible IDE.
